                        <li>If the payment processor agency is offline for any reason, then the
                            customer will be asked to return at a later time to create their
                            agreement. However, since the Direct Debit Sales Order is in a
                                <b>Closed</b> state, the online customer cannot access it and must

        <prereq>In order for customers to select Direct Debit as a payment method, System Admins
            must enable Direct Debit on the related Store. The Business Group identified on the
            Store record must have a Direct Debit Setting saved. Direct Debit enabled items can be
            purchased from a Store that is not Direct Debit enabled, however the customer will not
            be able to create a Direct Debit Agreement. <p>Additionally, Direct Debit items must be
                added to a Catalog in order to be added to the customerâ€™s cart. <b>Only items that
                    are Direct Debit enabled can be purchased with the Direct Debit payment
                    option</b>.</p></prereq>
