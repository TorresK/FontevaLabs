 <title>Grace Period</title>
 <abstract>The <b>Grace Period</b> functionality allows staff users to define a period of time
  called a <b>Grace Period</b> on the subscription plan that will allow for two pieces of
  functionality: <ul id="ul_l4t_hfl_rv">
   <li>The subscriber will receive benefits of the subscription through the end of the grace period.
    This means that badges assigned to the subscriber will have an <b>Expired Date </b>defined by
    the <b>Grace Period End Date</b> on the Subscription record.</li>
   <li> If a subscriber allows their subscription to lapse but remains within the grace period upon
        renewal, the start date of the new term will start the day after the subscriptionâ€™s paid
        through date just as if they had renewed on without letting their membership expire.
            <note><b>Example: Paid Through Date = 12/31/2016, Grace Period End Date = 2/28/2017,
            Renewal Date = 1/15/2017, New Term Start Date: 1/1/2017</b></note></li>
  </ul></abstract>

  <p><b>Setup</b><ol id="ol_zlv_4fl_rv">

     field. <p>You can now navigate to any subscription and see the Grace Period End Date populated
      to be the <b>Paid Through Date</b> plus the <b>Grace Period</b>. </p></li>
