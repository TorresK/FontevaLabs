    <title>Setting up Deferred Revenue</title>
    <abstract><b>Deferred Revenue</b> is a liability because it refers to revenue that has not yet
        been earned, but represents products or services that are owed to the customer. As the
        product or service is delivered over time, it is recognized as revenue on the income
        statement. When the deferred revenue becomes earned, an adjusting entry is prepared that
        will debit the Unearned Revenues or Deferred Revenues account and will credit the Sales
        Revenues or Service Revenues account. <note><b>Users can enable Defer Revenue on a per item
                basis. Additionally, revenue cannot be deferred for items with Lifetime Subscription
                Plans.</b></note></abstract>

                                of the day it was purchased. For example, if an annual membership is
                                purchased in January, the first revenue recognition entry is made on
                                January 31st.  </li>

                                to 5, the first revenue recognition entry will not occur until the
