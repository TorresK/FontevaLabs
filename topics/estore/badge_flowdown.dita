 <title>Badge Flowdown</title>
 <abstract>Badge Flowdown allows users to assign a badge to a Parent Account and allow the Child
  Accounts and their related Contacts to receive any benefits of the badge. Badge Flowdown is
  composed of four primary components: <ul>
   <li><b>Enabling Badge Calculations</b></li>
   <li><b>Enabling Badge Flowdown</b>
   </li>
   <li><b>Disabling Badge Flowdown for specific Accounts</b></li>
   <li><b>Badges VisualForce Component on the Contact Detail Page</b></li>
  </ul><p>Badge records are not created for the Child Accounts and their Contacts. The system
   populates the Badges VisualForce Component on the Contact record for reporting
     purposes.<note><b>In order to view all the badges benefiting a Contact, the user must add the
     Badges Visualforce Component to the Contact record's page layout.</b><p><image

  <section><title>Enabling Badge Flowdown</title>  
   <p>To enable Badge Flowdown: <ol>
     <li>Navigate to the <b>Badge Type</b> to be enabled for flowdown.</li>
     <li>Check the <b>Enable Badge Flowdown</b> checkbox and click <b>Save</b>.<note><b>Type</b>

  </section>
<section><title>Disabling Badge Flowdown</title>
<p>The <b>Disable Badge Flowdown</b> checkbox allows users to define specific accounts that cannot
    receive benefits if flowdown badges are assigned to their parent accounts. To disable badge
    flowdown: <ol>
     <li>Navigate to the Account to be removed from badge flowdown.</li>
     <li>Check the <b>Disable Badge Flowdown</b> checkbox and click <b>Save</b>.</li>
    </ol></p></section>
  <section><title>Badges Field and VisualForce Component</title>
   <p>Records are not created for all Contacts when badges are assigned to an Account, nor are
    badges created for Child Accounts and their Contacts when an Account receives a badge that is
    enabled for badge flowdown. To report on assigned badges, users can use the <b>Badges</b> field
    on the Contact record. </p>
   <p><b>Badges are available to display based upon three relationships:</b>
    <ol>
     <li>Direct relationships are badges that are directly assigned to the contact record. </li>
     <li>Inherited relationships are the badges that are assigned to the related account
      record.</li>
     <li>Flowdown relationships are the badges that are assigned to the related accountâ€™s parent
      account and where the badge is enabled for flowdown. <p>The <b>Badges</b> field is a Long Text
       Area field that concatenates every badge that gets assigned to a Contact, Account, or Parent
       Account when the <b>Enable Badge Flowdown</b> checkbox is checked. To view badges assigned to
       a contact (inherited, direct, and flowdown) navigate to the Contact record.</p></li>
