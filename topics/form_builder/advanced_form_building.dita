        <li>Provide feedback to event Sponsors<p><b>User Scenarios: </b><ul id="ul_tyc_wg1_ts">
              <li>Whenever someone registers for a conference, the organization needs to find out
                what size t-shirt they want, if they have any dietary restrictions, and if they have
                a disability that requires special accommodation. </li>
              <li>After the conference, the organization sends a survey to participants to get their
                feedback. </li>
              <li>When someone applies for membership, they are asked to supply background
                information so the organization can determine if they are qualified to join. </li>
              <li>A community group wants to know more about its membersâ€”why they joined the group,
                what they hope to get out of it, and what their interests are. </li>
              <li>The event organizers would like to open their conference to submissions from the
                community. Submitters must include the talk title and abstract, upload a copy of
                their slides, and provide links to audio or video of their previous speaker
                engagements. </li>
            </ul></p></li>
